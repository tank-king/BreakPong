If you don't have python installed, you can go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version. Install it using the installer. Make sure to add python to Path during the installation (there is a small checkbox to select that option during the installation process).

Then you can type `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal, and once it has finished downloading the dependencies, you can run the game.
